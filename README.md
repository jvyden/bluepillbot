# Bluepill Bot

![Bluepill](https://github.com/jvyden420/bluepillbot/blob/master/bluepill.png)

Welcome to the repo of Discord's most impractical bot.

## What does it do?
This bot will automagically react to every message it sees with a blue-pill emoji! The impracticality is off the charts!

With this bot, you will immediately kick it because of how useless and annoying it is!

Thats right, its a 100% guarantee that NOBODY WILL LIKE THIS BOT!

Best of all, **ITS FREE!** *AND* RECYCLABLE!


## Setup
If you don't want to set this up, [invite this bot to your server](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=599787587602874393&permissions=64&scope=bot)!

As long as you give the bot permissions to add reactions, you should be good to go.

### Actual setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/jvyden420/bluepillbot/`

2. `npm install`

3. `echo "TOKEN GOES HERE" >> token.txt`

4. `./alwaysrun`

aaand thats pretty much it

If you want it to react with a different emoji, you can change that in the main.js file at the top. 

*ill probably make a config file soon*
